### Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.


### Example 1:

```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted..

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
```

 
### Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 5000
- 0 <= A[i] <= 5000
- Accepted
 
 

### Solution :
 Using The Concept of reminder 
 **Time Complexity : O(n)**
