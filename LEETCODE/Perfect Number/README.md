### Problem Statement

We define the Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors except itself.

Now, given an integer n, write a function that returns true when it is a perfect number and false when it is not.


### Example 1:

```
- Input: 28
- Output: True
- Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
```

 
### NOTE:


Note: The input number n will not exceed 100,000,000. (1e8)

 

### Solution :
 Using The Concept of reminder 
 **Time Complexity : O(n)**
