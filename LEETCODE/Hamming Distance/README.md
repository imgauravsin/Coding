## Hamming Distance
### Problem Statement

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.


### Example 1:

```
Give 
- Input: x = 1, y = 4

- Output: 2

- Explanation:
- 1   (0 0 0 1)
- 4   (0 1 0 0)
-        ↑   ↑

- The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```
