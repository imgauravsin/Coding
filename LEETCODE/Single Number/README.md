### Problem Statement
Given a *non-empty* array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

*Note:*

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


### Example 1:

```
- Input: [2,2,1]
- Output: 1
```

### Example 2:

```
- Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
- Output: 4
```
 
 

### Solution :
 Using The Concept of reminder 
 **Time Complexity : O(n)**
